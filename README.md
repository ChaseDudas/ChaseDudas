<!---
Teams enjoy working and collaborating with me because of my strong communication skills, positive attitude, and empathy towards others.

As someone who has been in the tech industry and specifically the healthcare tech industry for over two years now, I deeply understand what it takes to work in a detail-oriented and ever-evolving industry. I am highly self-driven, as seen through my work at my former startup, and able to find creative solutions to overcome the most challenging problems.

I thrive in an inclusive and teamwork-driven atmosphere that promotes the diversity and uniqueness of every employee. I value a dynamic work culture where people can explore their passions and feel included in every setting.
